# Introduction

The T100 Thruster comes with two propellers, one clockwise and one counter-clockwise turning. This allows the torque from two thrusters to be cancelled if they are operated along the same axis with opposite propellers.

Changing the propeller is easy and should only take a minute.

## Tools You Need

* Phillips screwdriver with small tip
* 2 mm hex key
